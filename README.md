# FreeCryptographicAlgorithm

These files create the aforementioned weaponized obfuscation algorithm within a MacOS computer. It has not been tested extensively. This design holds zero warranty. That is not to say it is worthless. If you have a need to completely nuke someone's computer file system such that they will be unable to figure out how to regain the readability of a file, I would suggest that this algorithm has the potential to do that. On the other side of the coin, I believe that this algorithm equipped within a skilled mathematician's toolbox that requires a large dataset to quickly apply a complex nuclear type option to go techno-silent, i.e. disappear their own written records but retain a old school decrytption technique, i.e. a dead man's switch within a safe deposit box that flashbangs the info into a court proceeding upon the death of a client, or immediately initiates a deeply coded message within a text bomb deployment within an automated initiation sequence, etc, etc. I have done the labor to give the user a free and clear emergency use or at least an interesting test for cyptographic research for whomever is interested in the technology. I don't need confirmation of this payload being delivered, deployed, or it's efficacy during testing or implementation. I do not need to remain anonymous but I would prefer to remain anonimized with regards to this particular deployment. I don't require funding at this time. That is not to insinuate that I will never require funding for my work. I very much appreciate the community and simply would like this to be utilized for research purposes and in order to improve the human condition.
